<p> Mochi is my sister's dog, and we got her a little over two years ago. She is a true quarantine dog and therefore is scared of everyoneâ€” especially men. She hates my dad the most, and ironically loves my mom the most.
Currently Mochi is living in Arkansas, as my sister has gone to med school there. She enjoys the long winding pathways and nice greenery, which are very different from Baltimore which is where she used to live!</p>
